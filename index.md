Welcome [Greater St. Louis area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_St._Louis) and beyond!  We are the the local 
chapter serving Missouri and southern Illinois.  Our mission is to make software security visible, so that individuals 
and organizations worldwide can make informed decisions about software security risks.  

## Meetups

We try to meet 6 times per year with a mix of presentations, demonstrations, and hackathons (CTFs).

Meeting locations vary but we often meet in downtown St. Louis.  When meeting in person, food and drinks are provided 
by our generous sponsors.

## Participation

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of 
software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in 
improving application security. 

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the 
[Chapter Leader Handbook](/www-policy/rules-of-procedure/chapter-handbook). Financial contributions should only be 
made online using the authorized online donation button. To be a speaker at any OWASP Chapter in the world simply,
review the [speaker agreement](/www-policy/speaker-agreement) and then contact the local chapter leaders with details 
of what OWASP Project, independent research, or related software security topic you would like to present.
